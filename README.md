# StreamIt

Runs the church YouTube live stream from a Stream Deck. A Rust workspace for Windows 11 x64.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable 1.98, MSVC toolchain (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`).
- GStreamer 1.24+ MSVC 64-bit, **complete** install (includes the `decklink` plugin and the gst-plugins-rs `ndi` plugin).
- NDI 6 Runtime.
- Blackmagic Desktop Video (DeckLink driver).
- Companion must not be running on the playout PC.

Video format everywhere is 1080p29.97.

## Build

```
cargo test --workspace
```

The default build and tests need none of the external runtimes. The real playout build, which links GStreamer, uses `--features gst`:

```
cargo build --release --features gst
```

Without `--features gst` the app wires a stand-in player and counter that report as down.

## Probe your devices

_More entries are added by later tasks (device discovery and the other probes)._

### VideoHub

Prints the raw dump the VideoHub sends on connect, then its routes (numbered from 1, as on the front panel):

```
cargo run -p streamit-videohub --example probe -- 192.168.4.100 dump
```

Save the raw dump over `crates/streamit-videohub/tests/fixtures/videohub_dump.txt` so the tests parse a real capture.

To test a route (this really switches the router, so only do it when nothing live depends on that output):

```
cargo run -p streamit-videohub --example probe -- 192.168.4.100 route <output> <input>
```

### Web Presenter 4K

Prints the raw state the Web Presenter sends on connect (control port 9977), then the stream status it parsed:

```
cargo run -p streamit-webpresenter --example probe -- 192.168.4.93 dump
```

Save the raw dump over `crates/streamit-webpresenter/tests/fixtures/webpresenter_dump.txt` so the tests parse a real capture. If the block names differ from the ones the client expects (`STREAM STATE:` with `Status:` / `Action:` lines), fix the parser and the tests to match the capture.

To read the status, then start and stop streaming (this really starts the encoder, so set the YouTube key first and keep the broadcast non-public):

```
cargo run -p streamit-webpresenter --example probe -- 192.168.4.93 status
cargo run -p streamit-webpresenter --example probe -- 192.168.4.93 start
cargo run -p streamit-webpresenter --example probe -- 192.168.4.93 stop
```
